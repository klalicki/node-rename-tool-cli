##About this folder
This folder should contain jpg images, named with the following format:
`xxxxxxxxx_y.jpg`
where `xxxxxxxxx` is a consistent value (ie 'asset') and `y` is a placeholder for either null or a number. This script is designed to be a complement to InDesign's data merge feature, so it expects the following number sequence:
- asset_.jpg
- asset_2.jpg
- asset_3.jpg
- asset_4.jpg
